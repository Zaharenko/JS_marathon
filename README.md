# I created a couple of mini games and one beautiful slider
1. aim-game-sources - In this implementation, the target is a circle that randomly moves across the screen. The player clicks on a target to increase their score. Each time the target is clicked, the score increases by one and the target moves to a new random location on the screen. The current grade is displayed on the page. You can also select a timer.
2. board-sources - This game allows you to draw drawings just by moving your mouse over a given area.
3. drag-n-drop-sources - Table with the ability to transfer completed tasks to other table cells.
4. slider-sources - Cool effect of changing slides on the screen.
